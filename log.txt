--------------------- Lab notebook for 'emacs' assignment ---------------------

First I built the emacs program with

  $ make

Then for testing out interactive emacs I created the file 'num-search.el' with
the function 'multiply-by-seven'

  (defun multiply-by-seven (number)
		"Multiply NUMBER by seven."
		(interactive "p")
		(message "The result is: %d" (* 7 number)))

Then I tested this function out with

  $ src/emacs
  $ (emacs) M-x load-file
  $ (emacs) lisp/num-search.el RET
  $ (emacs) M-5 M-x multiply-by-seven RET

    The result is: 35

This shows that my test has worked out nicely
