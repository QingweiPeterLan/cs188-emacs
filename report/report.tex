\section{Introduction}

Emacs currently supports POSIX style regular expressions and the objective of the paper is to outline a method of integrating Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) into Emacs.

We want to support this because PCRE supports powerful features that the original POSIX style doesn't support. Integrating PCRE will greatly enhance productivity for Emacs users.
